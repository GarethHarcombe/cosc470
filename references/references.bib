  abstract  = {This article presents the performance results of a novel algorithm for swimming analysis in real-time within a low-power wrist-worn device. The estimated parameters are: lap count, stroke count, time in lap, total swimming time, pace/speed per lap, total swam distance, and swimming efficiency (SWOLF). In addition, several swimming styles are automatically detected. Results were obtained using a database composed of 13 different swimmers spanning 646 laps and 858.78 min of total swam time. The final precision achieved in lap detection ranges between 99.7\% and 100\%, and the classification of the different swimming styles reached a sensitivity and specificity above 98\%. We demonstrate that a swimmers performance can be fully analyzed with the smart bracelet containing the novel algorithm. The presented algorithm has been licensed to ICON Health \& Fitness Inc. for their line of wearables under the brand iFit.},

  abstract     = {A machine learning method is developed which is capable of making predictions of nonlinear ship motions in a range of wave conditions when trained on response data from only a single seaway. The method is formulated around the equations of motion in the time domain, but the equations are augmented with data-driven terms that act to correct the force-balance in the equations. The data-driven nonlinear forcing terms are modeled using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. The resulting hybrid governing equations are solved numerically. Predictions from the method are compared to nonlinear test data of 2-DOF motion of a Generic Prismatic Planing Hull (GPPH) at forward speed in head seas, with time histories given for both regular and irregular waves. The training data requirements to classify a specific seaway are investigated and quantified. Predictions over a range of significant wave heights and peak periods are performed using training data from only a single seaway to show the effectiveness of the method in generalizing across different environmental conditions.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a Newton extremum seeking algorithm based iterative learning coordinated control (Newton-ILC) strategy for contouring motion accuracy of precision multiaxial systems. Specifically, as the contouring error estimation is critically important for coordinated contouring motion control, a cost function is constructed based on the reference contour, as well as the current position, and the minimal value of the function is searched to determine the contouring error point through an offline Newton algorithm. Consequently, high precision estimation of the contouring error can be achieved, even under extreme contouring tasks with high speed, large curvature, and sharp corners. The calculated contouring error is then projected to each axis, and the axial contouring errors are controlled by iterative learning method, while the learning results will be used to adjust the axial position reference commands for contouring accuracy improvement. Comparative experiments are conducted on a biaxial linear motor stage to validate the practical effectiveness of the proposed Newton-ILC strategy. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed Newton-ILC achieves not only nearly perfect contouring error estimation but obvious improvement of contouring accuracy as well after a few iterations. Particularly, in some extreme cases such as large initial tracking error, high speed, large curvature, and sharp corners, the proposed Newton-ILC strategy can achieve rather excellent contouring performance when compared with individual axis control, conditional cross-coupled control, and cross-coupled iterative learning coordinated control (CCILC) methods.},

  abstract     = {For the online prediction of nonlinear systems with characteristics of time-varying dynamics and uncertainty, a sequential grey prediction approach is proposed based on the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM). The grey processing of time series alleviates the unfavorable effects of uncertainty in measurement data; the extremely fast learning speed and high generalization accuracy of OS-ELM enable online application of the sequential grey prediction approach. Ship's roll motion at sea is a complex nonlinear process with time-varying dynamics. Its dynamics also involves uncertainty caused by wind, random waves and rudder actions. In this paper, the proposed OS-ELM-based grey prediction approach is implemented for online ship roll prediction. The simulation of prediction is based on measurement data obtained from sea trials of the scientific research and training ship Yu Kun. Simulation results of ship roll prediction demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed grey neural prediction approach in dealing with time-varying nonlinear system with uncertainty.},

  abstract  = {Sports and international tournaments have gained world attention in the past decade. Enhancing sports activities and promoting sports to participate in international events, competitions, and tournaments play a substantial role in the development and advancement of nations around the globe. In this paper, we applied different deep learning models for predicting athletes' performance in tournaments to help them improve their results. We propose a deep learning selection algorithm to evaluate the effectiveness of the athletes' current training by predicting their race results upon completing each additional training, which potentially improves their performance. We gathered public training data for athletes who participated in the 2017 Boston Marathon within a five-month window prior to the race. Deep learning models were applied and evaluated to predict marathon finishing times. These include Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). Results show that Deep Learning models give improved race time prediction accuracy over the baseline machine learning model, such as standard Linear Regression (LR).},
