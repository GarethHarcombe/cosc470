"Mar 31, 2018, 1:42:12 AM","It's up the Tiki trail, but they're pretty much the same thing. And thanks, but I wasn't going very fast haha"
"Mar 31, 2018, 6:54:51 PM","Yeah I'm pretty sure my watch messed up... If you look at the map it looks like I went in the Lake, but I returned home the same way I went up."
"Apr 3, 2018, 5:38:14 AM",Quite possibly!
"Apr 3, 2018, 5:43:28 AM","Ah nice. I only went to the saddle, good effort going to the top!"
"Apr 4, 2018, 9:02:12 PM","Eh, I think most people just cruise around Lake Hayes at an easy pace..."
"Apr 19, 2018, 4:24:56 AM","Bad GPS data, has CR 5 mins faster than national champ but almost runs"
"May 12, 2018, 6:27:55 AM","Haha yep, was just updating it as I can't define the activity type on my watch"
"Oct 14, 2018, 6:42:25 AM","Eh, it'd be a good place to run in the summer."

"Jan 9, 2019, 2:47:37 AM","Nah, I probably would have been too slow"
"Jan 20, 2019, 4:28:08 AM",Something like that

"Jul 28, 2019, 7:46:13 PM","[strava://athletes/3569575/14]James Harcombe Yes, the track seemed pretty open to me. And it was an easy jog, I walked sections of the CR due to snow and mud"
"Sep 14, 2019, 10:55:16 AM",Thanks!
"Sep 23, 2019, 7:18:57 PM",Sadly I think they're due to GPS inaccuracies... Imagine drawing things in your GPS data [strava://athletes/3982060/14]Aleks Cheifetz ...
"Oct 1, 2019, 11:17:24 PM",Yeah I bet you wish you could do that eh? Oh wait...

"Dec 25, 2019, 4:43:01 AM","Oh haha, fair enough!"

"Jan 31, 2020, 6:39:10 PM",Thanks!
"Feb 1, 2020, 11:10:03 PM","Haha, maybe I should try that during the next race..."
"Feb 11, 2020, 4:21:34 AM","Well it‚Äôs flatter than Queenstown, but the actual ground is uneven so... Debatable"
"Feb 15, 2020, 11:04:49 PM",Unfortunately it is now
"Feb 16, 2020, 7:24:49 AM","Haha, hopefully!"
"Feb 18, 2020, 8:16:53 PM","Haha, neither, I‚Äôm going to have to make some adjusts..."
"Feb 20, 2020, 4:37:52 AM","Uh huh, especially when you do the 240m 5 seconds too fast... "
"Feb 23, 2020, 12:46:40 AM",8th I think?
"Feb 23, 2020, 4:35:42 AM","Yep, I‚Äôm at UC and thought I might as well go to the track for quick 800m"

"Mar 29, 2020, 5:23:59 AM",The blisters on my feet are telling me that I haven‚Äôt done anything that long in a while...
"Apr 5, 2020, 7:03:43 AM","Oi, play nice..."
"Apr 5, 2020, 7:44:07 AM","Well maybe he did a really hard session yesterday, and that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs so sore?"
"Apr 9, 2020, 1:24:40 AM","[strava://athletes/3982060/14]Aleks Cheifetz well, maybe the naming was just habitual..."
"Apr 10, 2020, 7:33:37 AM","What? I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about, it was just a very easy jog..."
"Apr 15, 2020, 6:05:43 AM","You also have to remember that it was with my dear father, so a fair amount of the up hill jogging was ‚Äòjogging‚Äô"
"Apr 19, 2020, 8:51:27 AM",Likewise!
"Apr 21, 2020, 7:13:43 AM","I mean, you tried..."

"May 12, 2020, 5:48:43 AM","Thank you so much for asking, after giving them a stern talking to, they‚Äôve hardened up (quite literally)"

"May 16, 2020, 6:12:51 AM","Thank you, it was complete chaos at the start so we had to get ahead of the main pack"
"May 22, 2020, 11:05:05 PM",Obviously the training is really helping...
"May 23, 2020, 6:24:59 AM","How could I be complaining, I was out of breath the entire time"

"Jun 13, 2020, 5:37:32 AM","[strava://athletes/11641409/13]Sarah Douglas Well I said around the gardens, which is less distance than Sunshine Bay so..."
"Jun 16, 2020, 6:54:54 PM",It had to be done
"Jun 21, 2020, 2:39:35 AM",Did you get any course records?
"Jul 1, 2020, 12:06:27 AM",Is that a PB?
"Jul 4, 2020, 6:15:42 AM",Just eh
"Jul 10, 2020, 9:02:33 AM","Hmm, maybe I need to eat some more"
